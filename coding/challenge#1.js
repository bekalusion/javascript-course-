// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

const markHeight = 1.88;
const markMass = 95;
const johnHeight = 1.76;
const johnMass = 85;

const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
    console.log(`mark's ${markBMI} is higher than john's ${johnBMI}`)
} else {
    console.log(`john's ${johnBMI} is higher than mark's ${markBMI}`)
}
